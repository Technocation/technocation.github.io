**Taste of Open Source**

Everyone likes to talk about open source, but we want to celebrate it. Join us for an evening of lightening talks, socializing, and networking. It will be a good time to learn about the ecosystem and who in Boston is supporting these efforts. So if you are in the tech business, are a developer, or are just interested in what this whole open source stuff is about... come join us for some fun.
